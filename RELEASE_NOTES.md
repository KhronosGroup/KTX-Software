Release Notes
=============
## Version 4.2.0
### Overview

v4.2.0 has few user-facing changes. Most of the work has been behind the scenes improving the build system and fixing warnings across the many supported compilers. User-facing changes are detailed below.

### New Features in v4.2.0

* Install packages for GNU/Linux on Arm64 have been added.

* The Java wrapper is now included in the Windows Arm64 install package.

### Significant Changes since v4.1.0

* The following behavioral changes have been made to `toktx`:

    * If the input PNG file has a gAMA chunk with a value 45460 the image data is now converted to the sRGB transfer function intead of just assigning sRGB as the transfer function of the output file.
    * If the gAMA chunk has a value other than 45640 or 100000 `toktx` will now exit with an error. Previously it used heuristics to decide whether to transform the input to linear or sRGB. Use `--convert_oetf` or `--assign_oetf` to specified the desired behavior.

* The Khronos Data Format header file `KHR/khr_df.h` has been added to the install packages and is included in `ktx.h`. A new transfer function query `ktxTexture2_GetOETF_e` that returns a `khr_df_transfer_e` replaces `ktxTexture2_GetOETF` that returned a `ktx_uint32_t`. The latter is still available for backward compatibility, A new `ktxTexture2_GetColorModel_e` query has been added returning a `khr_df_model_e`.

### Known Issues in v4.2.0.

* Some image bits in output files encoded to ASTC, ETC1S/Basis-LZ or UASTC on arm64 devices may differ from those encoded from the same input images on x86_64 devices. The differences will not be human visible and will only show up in bit-exact comparisons. 

* `toktx` will not read JPEG files with a width or height > 32768 pixels.

* `toktx` will not read 4-component JPEG files such as those sometimes created by Adobe software where the 4th component can be used to re-create a CMYK image.

* Users making Basisu encoded or block compressed textures for WebGL must be aware of WebGL restrictions with regard to texture size and may need to resize images appropriately using the --resize feature of `toktx`.  In general the dimensions of block compressed textures must be a multiple of the block size and for WebGL 1.0 must be a power of 2. For portability glTF's _KHR\_texture\_basisu_ extension requires texture dimensions to be a multiple of 4, the block size of the Universal texture formats.

* Basis Universal encoding results (both ETC1S/LZ and UASTC) are non-deterministic across platforms. Results are valid but level sizes and data will differ slightly.  See [issue #60](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal/issues/60) in the basis_universal repository.

* UASTC RDO results differ from run to run unless multi-threading or RDO multi-threading is disabled. In `toktx` use `--threads 1` for the former or `--uastc_rdo_m` for the latter. As with the preceeding issue results are valid but level sizes will differ slightly. See [issue #151](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal/issues/151) in the basis_universal repository.

* Neither the Vulkan nor GL loaders support depth/stencil textures.

### Notice

* Building with Visual Studio 2015 and 2017 is no longer supported.
