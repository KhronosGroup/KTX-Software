There are two sets of tools: a new set with a unified front end, @ref ktx, and an older set of individual tools. Both are documented here.

ktx Overview
------------

@ref ktx includes the following tools:

| Tool | Description | Equivalent old tool |
| :--- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| @ref ktx_create | Create a KTX2 file from various input files | `toktx` |
| @ref ktx_extract | Export selected images from a KTX2 file | - |
| @ref ktx_encode | Encode a KTX2 file | `ktxsc` |
| @ref ktx_transcode | Transcode a KTX2 file | - |
| @ref ktx_info | Prints information about a KTX2 file | `ktxinfo` |
| @ref ktx_validate | Validate a KTX2 file | `ktx2check` |
| @ref ktx_help | Display help information about the ktx tools | - |

Equivalent old tools are deprecated and will be removed in the near future.

Some features of old tools are not currently available in their new equivalent.

| Old Tool | New Tool | Missing Features |
| :------: | :------: | ---------------- |
| @ref toktx  | @ref ktx_create "create" | JPEG and NBPM input and scaling/resizing. |
| @ref ktxsc  | @ref ktx_encode "encode" | ASTC encoding. This can be done in `create`. |

The command-line syntax and semantics differ from the old tools including, but not limited to:

* KTX 1.0 files are not supported by the new tools.

* Words in multi-word option names are connected with `-` instead of `_`.
* Individual option names may differ between the old and new tools.
* The `ktx validate` tool may be stricter than `ktx2check` or otherwise differ in behavior, as the new tool enforces all rules of the KTX 2.0 specification. In addition, all new tools that accept KTX 2.0 files as input will be validated in a similar fashion as they would be with the `ktx validate` tool and will fail on the first specification rule violation, if there is one. It also has the option to output the validation results in human readable text format or in JSON format (both formatted and minified options are available), as controlled by the `--format` command-line option.
* The `ktx validate` tool also supports validating KTX 2.0 files against the additional restrictions defined by the _KHR\_texture\_basisu_ extension. Use the `--gltf-basisu` command-line option to verify glTF and WebGL compatibility.
* The new `ktx info` tool produces a unified and complete output of all metadata in KTX 2.0 files and can provide output in human readable text format or in JSON format (both formatted and minified options are available), as controlled by the `--format` command-line option.
* The source repository also includes the JSON schemas that the JSON outputs of the `ktx info` and `ktx validate` tools comply to.
* The `ktx create` tool takes an explicit Vulkan format argument (`--format`) instead of inferring the format based on the provided input files as `toktx`, and thus doesn't perform any implicit color-space conversions except gamma 2.2 to sRGB. Use the `--assign-oetf`, `--convert-oetf`, `--assign-primaries`, and the new `--convert-primaries` for fine grained control over color-space interpretation and conversion.
* The `ktx create` tool does not support resizing or scaling like `toktx`, and, in general, does not perform any image transformations except the optional color-space conversion and mipmap generation options. Users should resize input images to the appropriate resolution before converting them to KTX 2.0 files.
* The `ktx create` and `ktx extract` tools consume and produce, respectively, image file formats that best suit the used Vulkan format. In general, barring special cases, 8-bit and 16-bit normalized integer formats are imported from and exported to PNG files, while integer and floating point formats are imported from and exported to EXR files based on predefined rules. This may be extended in the future using additional command line options and in response to support for other image file formats.
* The new tools and updated `libktx` support ZLIB supercompression besides the BasisLZ and Zstd supercompression schemes supported previously.

Please refer to the manual pages or use the `--help` command-line option for further details on the options available and associated semantics for each individual command.
