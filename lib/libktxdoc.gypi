              # the directory where the .doxy and .gyp files are stored.
              #
              # With Xcode, the current directory during project
              # build is one we need so we're good to go. However
              # we need to spawn another shell with -l so the
              # startup (.bashrc, etc) files will be read.
              #
              # With MSVS the working directory will be the
              # location of the vcxproj file. However when the
              # action is using bash ('msvs_cygwin_shell': '1',
              # the default, is set) no path relativization is
              # performed on any command arguments. If forced, by
              # using variable names such as '*_dir', paths will be
              # made relative to the location of the .gyp file.
              #
              # A setup_env.bat file is run before the command.
              # Apparently that .bat file is expected to be in the
              # same location as the .gyp and to cd to
              # its directory. That makes things work.
              #
              # Note that the same setup_env.bat is run by
              # rules but rules relativize paths to the vcxproj
              # location so cd to the .gyp home breaks rules.
              # Therefore in rules set 'msvs_cygwin_shell': '0.
              #
              # If using cmd.exe ('msvs_cygwin_shell': '0')

              # location *all* command arguments, that do not look
              # like options.
