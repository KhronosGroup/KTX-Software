# WebGL Examples

Requires WebAssembly and WebGL support.

## Texture

[Live demo: `texture/index.html`](https://basis-universal-webgl.now.sh/texture/)

Renders a single texture, using the transcoder (compiled to WASM with emscripten) to generate one of the following compressed texture formats:

* BC1
* BC3

Please note that both Firefox and Chrome support BC1, but due to an implementation issue in the code it doesn't work on Firefox yet. (It doesn't test for the "WEBGL_compressed_texture_s3tc" extension.)

On browsers that don't support BC1, there's a low-quality fallback code path for opaque textures (but no fallback for BC3 yet). Note that the fallback path only converts to 16-bit RGB images at the moment, so the quality isn't as good as it should be.

## glTF 3D Model

[Live demo: `gltf/index.html`](https://basis-universal-webgl.now.sh/gltf/)

Renders a glTF 3D model with `.basis` texture files, transcoded into one of the following compressed texture formats:

* DTX (BC1)
  * Tested in Chrome (Linux and macOS) and Firefox (macOS).
* ETC1
  * Tested in Chrome on Android, Pixel 3 XL.
* PVRTC (COMPRESSED_RGB_PVRTC_4BPPV1_IMG)
  * Tested in Chrome and Safari on iOS iPhone 6 Plus.

The glTF model in this demo uses a hypothetical `GOOGLE_texture_basis` extension. That extension is defined for the sake of example only â€“ the glTF format will officially embed Basis files within a KTX2 wrapper, through a new
extension that is [currently in development](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/pull/1612).

## Testing locally

See [how to run things locally](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/How-to-run-things-locally), or (with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed), run:

```
npx serve
```

The console will display a `localhost` URL for local testing, and (on supported WiFi networks and devices) may also display an IP address accessible by other devices on the same network. Note that mobile devices must support WebAssembly to run this demo.
