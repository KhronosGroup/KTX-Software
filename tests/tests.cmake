# This setting is critical when cross compiling and on Apple
# Silicon Macs. By default (MODE POST_BUILD) test discovery
# is done as a post build operation which runs the test
# executable to discover the list of tests as soon as it is
# built. This unsurprisngly fails when cross compiling as
# tests built for the target won't run on the host. It fails
# on Apple Silicon as all executables must be signed. Because
# most generators (Xcode certainly) set up signing as a post
# build operation which runs after the test discovery post
# build the test executable will not be signed.
#
# This setting delays test discovery until a test is run by
# which time the test executable will be signed and will most
# likely be on the intended target. For simplicity use this
# setting on all platforms.
