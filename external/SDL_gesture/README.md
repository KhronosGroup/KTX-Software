SDL_gesture.h
-------------

The Gesture API was removed from SDL3. As a migration path they provided this equivalent single-header library `SDL_gesture.h` that can be dropped into an SDL3-based project.

They do not make formal releases of this code; they say "just grab the latest and drop it into your project!"

See https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_gesture.
