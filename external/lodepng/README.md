# LodePNG

Sourced from https://github.com/KhronosGroup/lodepng/tree/split_decode_inflate which is a branch in a fork of https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng.

The branch in the fork has been modified to split decode and data inflation to allow it to work with our imageio library. A PR will be submitted to merge these changes into https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng.

The repo is 3MB but only the 2 files here are needed and it has no tags so 
using `git submodule` or `git subrepo` are unattractive options.
