# Code generation scripts that require a Vulkan SDK installation

# TODO: Rewrite scripts to generate the files from the Vulkan
# registry, vk.xml, in the Vulkan-Docs repo.

# NOTE: Since this must be explicitly included by setting an option,
# require sought packages. However, in order to give an informative
# error, REQUIRED is not used in the find_* commands.
#
# CAUTION: Outputs of custom commands are deleted during a clean
# operation so these targets result in clean deleting what are normally
# considered source files. There appears to be no easy way to avoid
# this. Since only project developers need to use these targets, and
# only occasionally, this misfeature can be tolerated.

if (NOT IOS AND NOT ANDROID)
# Not needed as local custom vulkan_core.h is used. Keeping
# in case we go back to the standard one.
#    # find_package doesn't find the Vulkan SDK when building for IOS.
#    # I haven't investigated why.
#    find_package(Vulkan REQUIRED)

    # the including file. If we change Vulkan_INCLUDE_DIR, other parts will
    # be affected.

# CAUTION: On Windows use a version of Perl built for Windows, i.e. not

# generated files have the correct the correct CRLF line endings. The ones
# mentioned write LF line endings (possibly related to some Cygwin or MSYS
# installation setting for handling of text files). The Perl scripts,
# unlike the Awk scripts, have not been modified to always write CRLF

# CAUTION: When a COMMAND contains VAR="Value" CMake messes up the escaping
# for Bash. With or without VERBATIM, if Value has no spaces CMake changes it
# to VAR=\"Value\". If it has spaces CMake changes it to "VAR=\"Value\"".
# The first causes the quotes to leak into the command that is reading VAR
# breaking, e.g. opening a file that has VAR's value as part of its name.
# The second causes Bash to look for the command 'VAR="Value"' causing it
# to exit with error.
#
# The only workaround I've found is to put the command in a string and invoke
# it with bash -c. This is what we'd have to do on Windows anyway as COMMAND
# defaults to cmd or powershell (not sure which). In this case CMake passes
# to bash a string of the form '"VAR=\"Value\" command arg ..."' which bash
# parses successfully.
