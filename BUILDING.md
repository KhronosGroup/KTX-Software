Building KTX
============

KTX uses the the [CMake](https://cmake.org) build system. Depending on your
platform and how you configure it, it will create project/build files (e.g. an Xcode project, a Visual Studio solution or Make files) that allow you to
build the software and more (See [CMake generators](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html)).

KTX consist of the following parts

- The `libktx` main library
- Command line tools (for Linux / macOS / Windows)
- Load test applications (for [OpenGL<sup>®</sup> 3](https://www.khronos.org/opengl), [OpenGLES<sup>®</sup>](https://www.khronos.org/opengles) or [Vulkan<sup>®</sup>](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan))
- Documentation

Supported platforms (please see their specific requirements first)

- [GNU/Linux](#gnulinux)
- [Apple macOS/iOS](#apple-macosios)
- [Web/Emscripten](#webemscripten)
- [Windows](#windows)
- [Android](#android)

The minimal way to a build is to clone this repository and run the following in a terminal

```bash
# Navigate to the root of your KTX-Software clone (replace with
# your actual path)
cd /path/to/KTX-Software

# This generates build/project files in the sub-folder `build`
cmake . -B build

# Compile the project
cmake --build build
```

This creates the `libktx` library and the command line tools. To create the complete project generate the project like this:

```bash
cmake . -B build -D KTX_FEATURE_LOADTEST_APPS=ON -D KTX_FEATURE_DOC=ON
```

If you need the library to be static, add `-D KTX_FEATURE_STATIC_LIBRARY=ON` to the CMake configure command (always enabled on iOS and Emscripten).

> **Note:**
>
> When linking to the static library, make sure to
> define `KHRONOS_STATIC` before including KTX header files.
> This is especially important on Windows.

If you want to run the CTS tests (recommended only during KTX development)
add `-D KTX_FEATURE_TOOLS_CTS=ON` to the CMake configure command and fetch
the CTS submodule. For more information see [Conformance Test Suite](#conformance-test-suite).

If you want the Basis Universal encoders in `libktx` to use OpenCL
add `-D BASISU_SUPPORT_OPENCL=ON` to the CMake configure command.

> **Note:**
> 
>  There is very little advantage to using OpenCL in the context
>  of `libktx`. It is disabled in the default build configuration.

> **Note:**
> 
> When building from a source `tar.gz` and not from the git repository directly, 
> it is recommended to set the variable `KTX_GIT_VERSION_FULL` to the
> associated git tag (e.g `v4.3.2`)
> 
> ```bash
> cmake . -G Ninja -B build -DKTX_GIT_VERSION_FULL=v4.3.2
> ```
> Use with caution.

Building
--------

### GNU/Linux

You need to install the following

- [CMake](https://cmake.org)
- gcc and g++ from the [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org)
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) or [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) (recommended)
- [Doxygen](#doxygen) and [dot](#dot-\(graphviz\)) (only if generating documentation)

To build `libktx` such that the Basis Universal encoders will use
OpenCL you need

- OpenCL headers
- OpenCL driver

On Ubuntu and Debian these can be installed via

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libzstd-dev ninja-build doxygen graphviz opencl-c-headers mesa-opencl-icd
```

`mesa-opencl-icd` should be replaced by the appropriate package for your GPU.

On Fedora and RedHat these can be installed via

```bash
sudo dnf install make automake gcc gcc-c++ kernel-devel cmake libzstd-devel ninja-build doxygen graphviz mesa-libOpenCL
```


To build the load test applications you also need to install the following

- [SDL2](sdl2) development library
- [assimp](assimp) development library
- OpenGL development libraries
- Vulkan development libraries
- [Vulkan SDK](#vulkan-sdk)
- zlib development library

On Ubuntu and Debian these can be installed via

```bash
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dev libvulkan1 libvulkan-dev libassimp-dev
```

On Fedora and RedHat these can be installed via

```bash
sudo dnf install SDL2-devel mesa-libGL mesa-libGL-devel mesa-vulkan-drivers assimp-devel
```

KTX requires `glslc`, which comes with [Vulkan SDK](#vulkan-sdk) (in sub-
folder `x86_64/bin/glslc`). Make sure the complete path to the tool is in
in your environment's `PATH` variable. If you've followed Vulkan SDK
install instructions for your platform this should already be set up. You
can test it by running

```bash
# Should output version number.
glslc --version
# If it fails, try this then repeat the above.
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/vulkansdk/x86_64/bin
```

You should be able then to build like this

```bash
# First either configure a debug build of libktx and the tools
cmake . -G Ninja -B build
# ...or alternatively a release build including all targets
cmake . -G Ninja -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D KTX_FEATURE_LOADTEST_APPS=ON -D KTX_FEATURE_DOC=ON

# Compile the project
cmake --build build
```

### Apple macOS/iOS

You need to install the following

- CMake
- Xcode or, if using a different build system, the Xcode command line tools.
- [Doxygen](#doxygen) and [dot](#dot-\(graphviz\)) (only if generating documentation)

To build the load test applications you also need to install

- [vcpkg](#vcpkg) (which will automatically install the actual dependencies: [SDL2](sdl2) and [assimp](assimp))
- [Vulkan SDK](#vulkan-sdk)

Other dependencies (like OpenGL) come with Xcode.

For the load test applications you must also set these environment variables:

- `VCPKG_ROOT` to the location where you installed [vcpkg](#vcpkg).
- `VULKAN_SDK` to the `macOS` folder in your VulkanSDK installation. This can be set with the command `. /path/to/your/vulkansdk/setenv.sh`.

> **Note:** If using the CMake GUI or Xcode IDE you must ensure `VULKAN_SDK` is
> made available to them.

> **Note:** `VULKAN_SDK` is essential when bulding for iOS. When building for
> macOS it is not necessary if you selected _System Global Installation_ when
> installing the SDK.

> **Note:** the `iphoneos` or `MacOSX` SDK version gets hardwired into the
> generated projects. After installing an Xcode update that has the SDK for a
> new version of iOS, builds will fail. The only way to remedy this is to delete
> the CMake cache and reconfigure and regenerate from scratch. Use of a
> [`CMakeUserPresets.json`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html)
> file to capture unchanging settings is recommended.

#### macOS

To build for macOS:

```bash
# This creates an Xcode project at `build/mac/KTX-Software.xcodeproj`
# containing the libktx and tools targets.
mkdir build
cmake -G Xcode -B build/mac

# If you want to build the load test apps as well, set the
# `KTX_FEATURE_LOADTEST_APPS` and `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`
# parameters. vcpkg will automatically install the dependencies.
cmake -GXcode -Bbuild/mac -D KTX_FEATURE_LOADTEST_APPS=ON -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$VCPKG_ROOT/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

# Compile the project
cmake --build build/mac
```
##### Apple Silicon and Universal Binaries

Macs are either based on Intel or the newer Apple Silicon architecture. By default CMake configures to build for your host's platform, whichever it is. If you want to cross compile universal binaries (that support both platforms), add the parameter `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="\$(ARCHS_STANDARD)"` to cmake.

> **Known limitations:**
> - Intel Macs have support for SSE, but if you're building universal binaries,
>   you have to disable SSE or the build will fail

Example how to build universal binaries

```bash
# Configure universal binaries and disable SSE 
cmake -G Xcode -B build-macos-universal -D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="\$(ARCHS_STANDARD)" -D BASISU_SUPPORT_SSE=OFF
# Build 
cmake --build build-macos-universal
# Easy way to check if the resulting binaries are universal

file build-macos-universal/Debug/libktx.dylib
# outputs:
# build-macos-universal/Debug/libktx.dylib: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: [x86_64:Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library x86_64] [arm64]
# build-macos-universal/Debug/libktx.dylib (for architecture x86_64):	Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library x86_64
# build-macos-universal/Debug/libktx.dylib (for architecture arm64):	Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library arm64

file build-macos-universal/Debug/ktx
# outputs:
# build-macos-universal/Debug/ktx: Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures: [x86_64:Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64] [arm64:Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64]
# build-macos-universal/Debug/ktx (for architecture x86_64):	Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
# build-macos-universal/Debug/ktx (for architecture arm64):	Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
```

To explicity build for one or the other architecture use
`-D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64` or `-D CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64`

##### macOS signing

To sign the applications you need to set the following CMake variables:

| Name | Value |
| :--: | ----- |
| XCODE\_CODE\_SIGN\_IDENTITY | Owner* of the _Developer ID Application_ certificate to use for signing. |
| XCODE\_DEVELOPMENT\_TEAM | Development team of the certificate owner.

To sign the installation package you need to set the following variables:

| Name | Value |
| :--: | ----- |
| PRODUCTBUILD\_IDENTITY\_NAME | Owner* of the _Developer ID Installer_ certificate to use for signing. |
| PRODUCTBUILD\_KEYCHAIN\_PATH | Path to the keychain file with the certificate. Blank if its in the default keychain.

#### iOS

To build for iOS:

```bash
# This creates an Xcode project at `build/ios/KTX-Software.xcodeproj`
# containing the libktx targets.
mkdir build # if it does not exist
cmake -G Xcode -B build/ios -D CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS

# This creates a project to build the load test apps as well.
cmake -G Xcode -B build/ios -D KTX_FEATURE_LOADTEST_APPS=ON -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$VCPKG_ROOT/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

# Compile the project
cmake --build build -- -sdk iphoneos
```

If using the CMake GUI, when it asks you to specify the generator for the project, you need to check _Specify options for cross-compiling_ and on the next screen make sure _Operating System_ is set to `iOS`.

##### iOS signing

To sign the applications you need to set the following CMake variables:

| Name  | Value |
| :---: | ----- |
| XCODE\_CODE\_SIGN\_IDENTITY | Owner* of the _Apple Development_ certificate to use for signing. |
| XCODE\_DEVELOPMENT\_TEAM | Development team used to create the Provisioning Profile. This may not be the same as the team of the _Apple Development_ certificate owner.
| XCODE\_PROVISIONING\_PROFILE | Name of the profile to use.

\* _Owner_ is what is formally known as the _Subject Name_ of a certificate. It
is the string displayed by the Keychain Access app in the list of installed
certificates and shown as the value of the _Common Name_ field of the _Subject
Name_ section of the details shown after double-clicking the certificate.

### Web/Emscripten

There are two ways to build the Web version of the software: using Docker or using your own Emscripten installation.

#### Using Docker

Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) which is available for GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows.

In the repo root run

```bash
scripts/build_wasm_docker.sh
```

This will build both Debug and Release configurations and will include the load test application. Builds are done with the official Emscripten Docker image. Output will be written to the folders `build/web-{debug,release}`.

If you are using Windows you will need a Unix-like shell such as the one with _Git for Windows_ or one in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run this script.

#### Using Your Own Emscripten Installation

Install [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org) and follow the [install instructions](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) closely. After you've set up your emscripten environment in a terminal, run the following:

**Debug:**

```bash
# Configure
emcmake cmake -B build-web-debug . -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

# Build
cmake --build build-web-debug --config Debug
```

**Release:**

```bash
# Configure
emcmake cmake -B build-web .

# Build
cmake --build build-web
```

To include the load test application into the build add `-DKTX_FEATURE_LOADTEST_APPS=ON` to either of the above configuration steps.

Web builds create three additional targets:

- `ktx_js` (libktx javascript wrapper - with write support)
- `ktx_js_read` (libktx_read javascript wrapper - read-only)
- `msc_basis_transcoder_js` (transcoder wrapper)

> **Note:** The libktx wrappers do not use the transcoder wrapper. They directly uses the underlying c++ transcoder.

### Windows

You need to install the following

- CMake
- Visual Studio 2019 or 2022
- [Doxygen](#doxygen) and [dot](#dot\(graphviz\)) (only if generating documentation)

To build the load test applications you also need to install

- [vcpkg](#vcpkg) (which will automatically install the actual dependencies: [SDL2](sdl2) and [assimp](assimp))
- [Vulkan SDK](#vulkan-sdk)

For the load test applications you must also set these environment variables:

- `VCPKG_ROOT` to the location where you installed [vcpkg](#vcpkg).
- `VULKAN_SDK` to the location where you installed VulkanSDK. Normally this is set during installation of the SDK.

Additional requirement for the OpenGL ES version of the load tests application

- [OpenGL ES emulator](#opengl-es-emulator-for-windows).

CMake can create solutions for Microsoft Visual Studio (2019 and 2022 are supported by KTX).

> **Note:** x86 (32-bit) Windows is not supported.

To build for Windows

```powershell
# This creates a solution at `build/KTX-Software.sln`
# containing the libktx and tools targets. 
cmake -B build .

# If you want to build the load test apps as well, set the
# `KTX_FEATURE_LOADTEST_APPS` and `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`
# parameters. vcpkg will automatically install the dependencies.
cmake -B build . -D KTX_FEATURE_LOADTEST_APPS=ON -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$env:VCPKG_ROOT/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

# Compile the project
cmake --build build
```

To configure for Universal Windows Platform (Windows Store) you have to

- Set the platform to `x64`, `ARM` or `ARM64` (depending on your target device/platform)
- Set the system name to `WindowsStore`
- Provide a system version (e.g. `10.0`)

> **Note:** Support is currently limited to `ktx` and `libktx_read` (no tools, tests or load tests apps)

Example UWP configuration

```powershell
cmake . -A ARM64 -B build_uwp_arm64 -D CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME:String=WindowsStore -D CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION:String="10.0"
# Build `ktx.dll` only
cmake -B build_uwp_arm64 --target ktx
```

A `bash` shell is needed by the `mkversion` script used during the build. If you installed your `git` via the
[Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) package you are good to go.
Alternatives are
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) plus a Linux distribution or [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). A contribution of a PowerShell equivalent script will be welcomed.

The NSIS compiler is needed if you intend to build packages.

CMake can include OpenGL ES versions of the KTX loader tests in the
generated solution. To build and run these you need to install an
OpenGL ES emulator. See [below](#opengl-es-emulator-for-windows).

##### Windows signing

To sign applications and the NSIS installer you need to import your certificate to an Azure Key Vault or to the Current User or Local Machine certificate store.
The latter can be done interactively with Windows' commands `certmgr` and
`certlm` respectively. You need to set the following CMake variables to
turn on signing:

| Name  | Value |
| ---: | ----- |
| CODE\_SIGN\_KEY\_VAULT | Where the signing certificate is stored. One of _Azure_, _Machine_, _User_. |
| CODE\_SIGN\_TIMESTAMP\_URL | URL of the timestamp server to use. Usually provided by the issuer of your certificate. Timestamping is required as it keeps the signatures valid even after certificate expiration.

The following additional variables must be set if using Azure:

| Name  | Value |
| ---: | ----- |
| AZURE\_KEY\_VAULT\_CERTIFICATE | Name of the certificate in Azure Key Vault.
| AZURE\_KEY\_VAULT\_CLIENT\_ID | Id of an application (Client) registered with Azure that has permission to access the certificate.
| AZURE\_KEY\_VAULT\_CLIENT\_SECRET | Secret to authenticate access to the Client.
| AZURE\_KEY\_VAULT\_TENANT\_ID | Id of the Azure Active Directory (Tenant) holding the Client.
| AZURE\_KEY\_VAULT\_URL | URL of the key vault

If using a local certificate store the following variables must be set instead:

| Name  | Value |
| ---: | ----- |
| LOCAL\_KEY\_VAULT\_SIGNING\_IDENTITY | Subject Name of code signing certificate. Displayed in 'Issued To' field of cert{lm,mgr}. Overriden by LOCAL\_KEY\_VAULT\_CERTIFICATE\_THUMBPRINT.
| LOCAL\_KEY\_VAULT\_CERTIFICATE\_THUMBPRINT | Thumbprint of the certificate to use. Use this instead of LOCAL\_KEY\_VAULT\_SIGNING\_IDENTITY when you have multiple certificates with the same identity.

#### OpenGL ES Emulator for Windows

The `es1loadtests` and `es3loadtests` targets on Windows require an
OpenGL ES emulator.
[Imagination Technologies PowerVR](https://community.imgtec.com/developers/powervr/graphics-sdk/).
emulator is recommended. Any of the other major emulators listed below could also be used:

* [Qualcomm Adreno](https://developer.qualcomm.com/software/adreno-gpu-sdk/tools)
* [Google ANGLE](https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle/)<sup>*</sup>
* [ARM Mali](http://malideveloper.arm.com/resources/tools/opengl-es-emulator/)

If you want to run the `es1loadtests` you will need to use
Imagination Technologies' PowerVR emulator as that alone supports OpenGL ES
1.1. You must set the CMake configuration variable `OPENGL_ES_EMULATOR` to the directory containing the .lib files of your chosen emulator and ensure the .dlls are in your `$env:PATH` or co-located with `es1loadtests`.

<sup>*</sup>You will need to build ANGLE yourself.

#### OpenCL for Windows

To build `libktx` such that the Basis Universal encoders will use
OpenCL you need an OpenCL driver, which is typically included in the driver for your GPU, and an OpenCL SDK. If no SDK is present, the build will use the headers and library that are included in this repo.

### Android

Support is currently limited to libktx and libktx_read (no tools, tests or loadtest apps)

Requirements:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org)
- [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk)

The path to the NDK, a CMake toolchain file (that comes with the NDK), the desired Android ABI and minimum API level have to be provided when configuring with CMake (see [Android NDK CMake guide](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cmake) for more details/settings). Example:

```bash
export ANDROID_NDK=/path/to/Android_NDK #This is the location of Android NDK
# Configure
cmake . -B "build-android" \
-DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-24 \ # API level 24 equals Android 7.0
-DANDROID_ABI="arm64-v8a" \ # target platform
-DANDROID_NDK="$ANDROID_NDK" \
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$ANDROID_NDK/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake" \ # Toolchain file in a subfolder of the NDK
-DBASISU_SUPPORT_SSE=OFF # Disable SSE

# Build
cmake --build "build-android"
```

> Note: SSE has to be disabled currently (for ABIs x86 and x86_64) due to [an issue](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal/pull/233).

Conformance Test Suite
------------

The submodule of [CTS Repository](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software-CTS/) is optional and
only required for running the CTS tests during KTX development. If the CTS test suit is desired it
can be fetched during cloning with the additional `--recurse-submodules` git clone flag:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:KhronosGroup/KTX-Software.git
```

If the repository was already cloned or whenever the submodule ref changes the submodule has to be
updated with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive tests/cts
```

(For more information on submodules see the [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).)

Once the submodule is fetched the CTS tests can be enabled with the `KTX_FEATURE_TOOLS_CTS`
cmake option during cmake configuration. Please note that for `KTX_FEATURE_TOOLS_CTS` to take
effect both `KTX_FEATURE_TESTS` and `KTX_FEATURE_TOOLS` has to be also enabled.
The CTS integrates into `ctest` so running `ctest` will also execute the CTS tests too.
The test cases can be limited to the CTS tests with `ctest -R ktxToolsTest`.

Example for development workflow with CTS testing:

```bash
# Git clone and submodule fetch 
git clone git@github.com:KhronosGroup/KTX-Software.git
cd KTX-Software/
git submodule update --init --recursive tests/cts
# Configure 
mkdir build
cmake -B build . -DKTX_FEATURE_DOC=ON -DKTX_FEATURE_STATIC_LIBRARY=ON -DKTX_FEATURE_TOOLS_CTS=ON -DKTX_FEATURE_TESTS=ON -DKTX_FEATURE_TOOLS_CTS=ON
# Build everything (depending on workflow its better to build the specific target like 'ktxtools'):
cmake --build build --target all 
# Run every test case:
ctest --test-dir build
# Run only the CTS test cases:
ctest --test-dir build -R ktxToolsTest
```

To create and update CTS test cases and about their specific features and usages
see the [CTS documentation](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software-CTS/blob/main/README.md).

Generated Source Files (project developers only)
------------
All but a few project developers can ignore this section. The files discussed here only need to be re-generated when formats are added to Vulkan or errors are discovered. These will be rare occurrences. 

The following files related to the the VkFormat enum are generated from `vulkan_core.h`:

- lib/vkformat_check.c
- lib/vkformat_enum.h
- lib/vkformat_list.inl
- lib/vkformat_str.c
- lib/vkformat_typesize.c
- lib/dfd/dfd2vk.inl
- lib/dfd/vk2dfd.inl
- interface/java\_binding/src/main/java/org/khronos/ktxVkFormat.java
- interface/python\_binding/pyktx/vk\_format.py
- interface/js\_binding/vk\_format.inl


The following files are generated from the mapping database in the KTX-Specification repo by `generate_format_switches.rb`:

- lib/vkFormat2glFormat.inl
- lib/vkFormat2glInternalFormat.inl
- lib/vkFormat2glType.inl

All are generated by the `mkvk` target which is only configured if `KTX_GENERATE_VK_FILES` is set to `ON` at the time of CMake configuration. Since this setting is labelled *Advanced* it will not be visible in the CMake GUI unless `Advanced` is set.

Configuring this target adds some dependencies which are discussed below.

Dependencies
------------

### awk

Needed if you are [regenerating source files](#generatedsourcefiles(projectdevelopersonly)).

Standard on GNU/Linux and macOS. Available on Windows as part of Git for
Windows, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or Cygwin. Note that no CMake
`AWK_EXECUTABLE` cache variable is used because *awk* is standard on GNU/Linux
and macOS and on Windows *awk* tends to be available when *bash* is and there
the *awk* script is invoked via *bash*.

### bash

Needed for the script that creates the version numbers from `git describe` output. Also needed if you are [regenerating source files](#generatedsourcefiles(projectdevelopersonly)).

Standard on GNU/Linux and macOS. Available on Windows as part of Git for
Windows, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or Cygwin.

#### vcpkg

This package manager is needed to install the [SDL2](#sdl2) and [assimp](assimp)
dependencies of the KTX load test applications on macOS and Windows. Since
KTX-Software uses vcpkg's manifest mode, installation of the dependencies is
automatic.

Clone the [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) repo and run its
bootstrap:

```bash
    cd /place/to/clone/vcpkg
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
    cd vcpkg
    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh -disableMetrics
    # On Windows use ./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```

For more information see the
[vcpkg with CMake](https://learn.microsoft.com/vcpkg/get_started/get-started)
Getting Started guide. Ignore all but the installation instructions. Set the
environment variable `VCPKG_ROOT` to where you have installed _vcpkg_ and set
`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` to `$VCPKG_ROOT/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake` when
using CMake to configure your project.

### SDL2

Simple Direct Media Layer. Needed if you want to build the KTX load tests.

On GNU/Linux install `libsdl2-dev` using your package manager. On iOS, macOS
and Windows it will be automatically installed by [vcpkg](#vcpkg). Libraries installed by other package managers are typically not redistributable or
bundle-able.

Canonical source is at https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/SDL2.

### assimp

Open Asset Import Library. Needed if you want to build the KTX load tests.

On GNU/Linux install `libassimp-dev` using your package manager. On
iOS. macOS and Windows it will be automatically installed by [vcpkg](#vcpkg).

Canonical source is at https://github.com/assimp/assimp. 

### Vulkan SDK

Needed if you want to build the KTX Vulkan load tests, `vkloadtests`. The minimum required version is 1.3.283.0.

Download the [Vulkan SDK from Lunar G](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home).

For Ubuntu (20.04 and 22.04) install packages are available. See [Getting
Started - Ubuntu](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/1.3.290.0/linux/getting_started_ubuntu.html) for detailed instructions.

For other GNU/Linux distributions a `.tar.gz` file is available. See
[Getting Started - Tarball](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/1.3.290.0/linux/getting_started.html) for detailed instructions.

For Windows install the Vulkan SDK via the installer.

For iOS and macOS, install the Vulkan SDK by downloading the macOS installer and double-clicking _install_ in the mounted `.dmg`. This SDK contains MoltenVK (Vulkan Portability on Metal) for both iOS and macOS.

### Doxygen

Needed if you want to generate _libktx_, _ktxtools_ and other documentation.

You need a minimum of version 1.8.14 to generate the documentation correctly.
You can download binaries and also find instructions for building it from source
at [Doxygen downloads](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html). Make
sure the directory containing the `doxygen` executable is in your `$PATH`.

### dot (Graphviz)

Needed if you want Doxygen to generate include dependency, inverse include
dependency, inheritance and other graphs in the generated documentation.

You can download binaries from
[Graphviz downloads](https://graphviz.org/download/).

Optional. If not present documentation will be generated minus graphs. 

### OpenCL

Needed if you want to enable the Basis Universal encoders to use OpenCL when
building _libktx_.

On GNU/Linux and Windows you need to install an OpenCL SDK and OpenCL driver. Drivers are standard on macOS & iOS and Xcode includes the SDK. On GNU/Linux the SDK can be installed using your package manager. On Windows, the place from which to download the SDK depends on your GPU vendor. In both cases, the GPU driver typically includes an OpenCL driver. 

### Python

*If you are building pyktx*, review the requirements in the [pyktx](interface/python_binding/README.md) README.

### Perl

Needed if you are [regenerating source files](#generatedsourcefiles(projectdevelopersonly)).

On GNU/Linux install `perl` using your package manager. On macOS Perl is still
included as of macOS Sonoma. In future you may need to install an additional
package. On Windows, you need a Perl that writes Windows line endings (CRLF).
Strawberry Perl via Chocolatey is recommended.

```powershell
    choco install strawberryperl
```

### Ruby

Needed if you are [regenerating source files](#generatedsourcefiles(projectdevelopersonly)).

Ruby version 3 or later is required. On GNU/Linux install `ruby` using your
package manager. On macOS install using a package manager such as Brew or with
[RVM (Ruby Version Manager)](https://rvm.io/rvm/install). Note that Ruby is included in the Xcode command line tools but as of Xcode 15.3 is still version
2.6.  On Windows use [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/).

### KTX Specification Source

Needed if you are [regenerating source files](#generatedsourcefiles(projectdevelopersonly)).

`git clone https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Specification` to a peer
directory of your KTX-Software workarea or set the value of the
`KTX_SPECIFICATION` CMake cache variable to the location of your specification
clone.

Formatting
------------

The KTX repository is transitioning to enforcing a set of formatting guides, checked during CI.
The tool used for this is [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html).
To minimize friction, it is advised that one configure their environment to run ClangFormat in an automated fashion,
minimally before committing to source control, ideally on every save.

### Visual Studio Code

Set the [`editor.formatOnSave`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_formatting) option and use one of the C/C++ formatting extensions available, most notably [ms-vscode.cpptools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) or [llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd).
