  #   In the event that /src ends up having the same owner as the repo
  # (cwd) on the docker host, which is presumably the user running
  # this script, it is necessary to set the uid/gid used to run the
  # commands in docker. This is because the recent fix for
  # CVE-2022-24765 causes Git to error when the repo owner differs from
  # the user running the command. For details see
  # https://github.blog/2022-04-12-git-security-vulnerability-announced/
  #   When I run docker locally on macOS /src is owned by root which is
  # the default docker user so we don't trip over the CVE fix. However
  # on Travis /src ends up owned by the same uid as the repo on the host.
  # Since .travis.yml starts docker before calling this script, the correct
  # uid is set there. This is retained as an example in case some other
  # system exhibits the same behavior as Travis.
