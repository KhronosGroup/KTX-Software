name: Check config and build of just libktx

# The purpose of this is to smoke test building just libktx using its
# CMakeLists.txt as the top-level project. Testing of various build
# options and running of tests on the library is left to the various
# KTX-Software project workflows.

# Seems no way to avoid duplicating this on logic in each .yml file.
# See https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/issues/245.

  # Trigger the workflow on a pull request,

  push:
    # And on pushes to main, which will occur when a PR is merged.
    branches:
      - main
    # Also trigger on push of release tags to any branch. Useful
    # for testing release builds before merging to main.
