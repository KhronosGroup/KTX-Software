name: Publish Python 🐍 distribution 📦 to PyPI or TestPyPI

# https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish strongly recommends a
# separate publishing job when building platform-specific distribution
# packages, hence this.
#
# This should not be run until the release artifacts have been deployed.
# The only way I can see to trigger this automatically is to have all
# platform builds in a single workflow file and use on: `workflow_run`
# so this is triggered when that workflow completes. Once all platform
# builds are moved to GitHub Actions we can try making each platform
# workflow reusable and making another workflow that calls each of
# them via `uses` and use `on: workflow_run` here.
#
# We also have to figure out how to determine if the workflow deployed
# to releases. Maybe can use the GitHub REST API to get an artifact
# from the triggering workflow that is set only when deploying
# releases. See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#using-data-from-the-triggering-workflow.
# Alternatively maybe there is some way of querying what triggered
# the workflow that we can test in an `if:` in the job as noted below.

# An unknown is how to limit the trigger to when deploy is run in
# Windows CI which is happens when that workflow is triggered by
# a push with the tags below.
#  push:
#    # Trigger on push of release tags. There is no way to limit the trigger
#    # to a specific branch. A later build step checks for the main branch.
#    tags:
#      - 'v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+'
#      - 'v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+-*'
