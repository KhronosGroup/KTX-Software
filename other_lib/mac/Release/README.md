Library Information
===================

- libassimp is a custom build including only 3DS, Collada, FBX,
  glTF, obj and stl importers.
- libminizip is copied from my MacPorts /opt/local/lib folder.
- libSDL is a standard build done on my machine.
- libIrrXML.a is built by the libassimp build. It is required
  even though the XML importer is not included.
